Where Are You?
==============
This app lets you request the location of others by sending them a text message with a link. When the receiver clicks the link their location is send back to the sender and shown as a notification.

Works with all smart phones including Iphone. The receiver doesn't need to have the app installed.

Known bugs
==========
Latest version of google maps has a bug which forces you to open the app twice before it actually shows the right location.
In other words the first time you receive a location reponse you have to click it twice!


Open Source
===========
You can find the source code for this app at https://bitbucket.org/snot/where-are-you
The server side is open source as well but I'd like to clean it up a bit before publicly releasing. Which might never happen so if you want it feel free to send me a mail and you can have it.
